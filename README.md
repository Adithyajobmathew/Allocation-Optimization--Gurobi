# Allocation-Optimization--Gurobi
This problem is of taking a decision to send trucks from distribution centre to individual stores and the decision to send the volume of resources too. There are sixteen distribution centers and four thousand and eighty stores spread across the regions of united sates. I created an optimization model which can optimize the decision of sending a truck with calculated supplies from distribution centers to stores. The data used was dominos datasets and extensive cleaning and profiling had to be done. The CSV file format of the datasets was assimilated and converted to single SQL based database for faster data access and for consistency. For optimization, the GUROBI python package was used and the output was stored back to the SQL DATABASE.
